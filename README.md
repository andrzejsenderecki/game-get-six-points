# game-get-six-points

This is my first simple aplication which I wrote in Python language.

This is a game for 2 gamers. At first gamer 1 click button "Gamer 1! Click to draw your number!" and next gamer 2 click button "Gamer 2! Click to draw your number!".
This button draw numbers in range from -10 to 10 and add result to sum result gamer 1 or gamer 2.
Game will win gamer wchich as first get minimum 6 points! 

Code features:
- the game has two buttons for two gamers wchich draw number in range from -10 to 10 and adds result to current score gamer 1 or gamer 2

- the game has labels wchich display:
	- gamer 1 - current result
